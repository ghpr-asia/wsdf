**wsdf** (**W**ire**s**hark **D**issector **F**ramework) is a proc-macro based
framework to generate Wireshark dissectors from your Rust data types. Using
wsdf, you can write dissectors in a declarative way, all from within Rust.

Here is what a complete dissector for UDP looks like:

```rust
use wsdf::{protocol, version, Dissect, Proto};

version!("0.0,1", 4, 0);
protocol!(Udp);

#[derive(Proto, Dissect)]
#[wsdf(decode_from = [("ip.proto", 17)])]
struct Udp {
    src_port: u16,
    dst_port: u16,
    length: u16,
    checksum: u16,
    #[wsdf(subdissector = ("udp.port", "dst_port", "src_port"))]
    payload: Vec<u8>,
}
```

Check out the [docs](https://docs.rs/wsdf) for more information. Some
[examples](wsdf/examples/) are also available, including a simple dissector for
DNS, showcased below.

wsdf has been tested on Linux against Wireshark 4.0.
