**wsdf** is a proc-macro based framework to generate Wireshark dissectors from
your Rust data types. Using wsdf, you can write dissectors in a declarative
way, all from within Rust.

Here is what a dissector for UDP looks like:

```rust
#[derive(wsdf::Protocol)]
#[wsdf(decode_from = [("ip.proto", 17)])]
struct UDP {
    src_port: u16,
    dst_port: u16,
    length: u16,
    checksum: u16,
    #[wsdf(subdissector = ("udp.port", "dst_port", "src_port"))]
    payload: Vec<u8>,
}
```

Check out the [docs](https://docs.rs/wsdf) for more information. Some
[examples](wsdf/examples/) are also available, including a simple dissector for
DNS, showcased below.

wsdf has been tested on Linux against Wireshark 4.0.
